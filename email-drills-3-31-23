1. Function that takes a parameter which is an array of numbers (or anything) and prints each element. 
   hint (testing this function will need you to create an array literal)

2. Function that takes a parameter which is an array of numbers (or anything) and prints each element in reverse order.

3. Function takes parameter which is an array of numbers and RETURNS another array which only contains even elements from the input array
e.g parameter array [2,5,6,7,9] => returned array [2,6]
    (hint : Inside this function you'll need to create a new array to hold result and use .push to populate it with even numbers
     even number test is n % 2 == 0)

4. Same as 3 but new function that returns an odd numbered array
